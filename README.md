still REALLY unfinished, but the idea is to track running data and see if I can locate "lulls" in pace, and integrate that with spotify being played on my phone, and change the song via selenium's interaction with spotify web to a more motivational song to get me to speed up.

At the moment I am still figuring out how to parse and clean the fitness files provided by map my run. I would hope to also be able to work with live data, so still exploring that segment for the time being. 

Would also be cool to align this time series information with spotify songs, and see if there's any information there about songs that are shown to pump me up. If not, I can go on personal preference.
